I am writing to recommend Kasun Prabath for the Data Science Masters program at Harvard University. I had the pleasure of having Kasun as a student in my Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Colombo.

Kasun is a highly motivated and hardworking student with a strong aptitude for data science. He is always eager to learn new things and is always willing to help his classmates. Kasun is also an excellent communicator and has a knack for explaining complex technical concepts in a clear and concise way.

In my class, Kasun consistently scored at the top of the class. He was able to quickly grasp the concepts and was able to apply them to real-world problems. Kasun also showed a strong interest in the subject matter and was always willing to go the extra mile.

I believe that Kasun would be an asset to your program. He is a bright, motivated, and hard-working student with a passion for data science. I highly recommend him for admission to your program.
